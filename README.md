A complete Travel and Tourism Website developed using Django framework

Modules:
We divided our project into five modules

1.Tours Module

2.Bus Booking Module

3.Flight Booking Module

4.DataScience Module

5.Mathematical Programming Module



Tours Module:
The web page related to tourism i.e. tours page where user can see all the tour plans available in database and book a tour which matches his expectations. If end user didn't find a tour plan that covers all the tourist places he wanted to visit, he can create his own tour plan with his requirements.

Bus Booking Module :
All the features or web pages related to bus booking comes under this module. End user can view this page by clicking 'Book Bus', initially all the buses and their details available in database will be displayed to the user. And User can search for a particular bus by entering 'From', 'To' locations and date in the input fields provided. Then, only bus with that particular schedule will be shown to the user. Later user can see booked and available seats of a bus by clicking on 'view seats', after selecting he will be able to see ticket details and he can book the ticket by clicking on confirm button.

Mathematical Programming Module:
We developed two strong and very useful features using Fractional Knap-Sack Algorithm and Travelling Salesman Module from python. While create own tour, user will be asked to enter Maximum time(in days) and Maximum budget he wish to spend on the tour. Using fractional knap-sack we can display his plan by including the tourist places that fit to his requirements. And then user and manager will be able to see shortest path that covers all those tourist places.

Flight Booking Module:
All the features or web pages related to flight booking comes under this module. End user can view this page by clicking 'Book Flight', initially all the flights and their details available in database will be displayed to the user. And User can search for a particular flight by entering 'From', 'To' locations and date in the input fields provided. Then, only the flight with that particular schedule will be shown to the user. Later user can select the class of the seat and number of seats, he can book the ticket by clicking on confirm button.

Data Science Module:
This module includes all the Data Visualization Features that we developed using chartJs Library. End User Will be able to visualize data in the form of pie charts.

One pie chart is regarding - Number of people visiting to different Tourist Places.

Other pie chart is regarding- Number of people planning their tours in different seasons.
